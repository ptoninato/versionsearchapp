# VersionSearchApp

A Web App written in .NET Core using Razor.  It takes in an input, and checks for any software from a static list that has a version greater than what the user inputed.

A few things to add:

1. Unit Tests
2. Error Handling
3. Form Validaion to stop users from submitting bad requests
